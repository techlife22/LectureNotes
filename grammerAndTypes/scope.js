-Scope is how a computer keeps track of all the variables in a program
-Scopes can also be nested, where there is an outer scope(think global scope) that encloses an inner scope(think local scope)
    -Think about global scope as Planet Earth. Everything belongs to or is on Earth itself. WE live in Indianapolis, which could be considered our local scope.

-With the introduction of ES6 came two more keywords to declare variables: const and let
-const is constant that cannot be changed
-var and let seem to operate the same. But while they have a lot of the same functionality, they behave a little differently.
    -let is scoped to the nearest ENCLOSING block, where var is scoped to the nearest FUNCTION block
