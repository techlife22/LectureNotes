DOM stands for Document Object Model. It allows JS to interact with the HTML and CSS of our page.
The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can acess and update the contents of a webpage while it's in the browser window. 
-The DOM is an object-oriented representation of a webpage , which can be modified with a scripting language such as JS. The DOM covers two primary areas: 
        1.Making a model HTML page
            -when the browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of the page in memory
            -The DOM specifies the way in which browsers should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree.
            -The DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree itself is made up of objects
        2.Accessing and changing the HTML page
            -the DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser
        
            Accessing: 
                -Common methods for accessing a single element:
                -getElementByID()
                -querySelector()
            Common methods for accessing multiple elements:
                -querySelectorAll()
                -getElementByClassName()
                -getElementByTagName()

            Manipulating: 
                -Common properties/methods for working with HTML content:
                    -innerHTML
                    -textContent
                    -createElement()
                -Common properties/methods for working with tag attributes:
                    -className / id
                    -setAttribute()
                    -getAttribute()
